From **PrimeHub v3.0**, there are huge changes on UI for enhancing group-context experience which suits teams/projects much more , please check these changes if you come from PrimeHub v2.x or just skip to guides if you are newcomers.

## Changes

+ Users have their own group-context portal which display information within the context of the user-specified group.

+ Users can switch context among groups they join easily to have different context from other groups in portal.

+ Because group-context, jobs feature, schedule feature and models feature, these features list items *only within the context of group*. Furthermore, user-operations are also affected by the context of the group such as submitting jobs, creating job schedule and deploying models.

+ Because group-context, JupyterHub will be launched within the specified group without choosing a group from the spawner page.

## Guides
