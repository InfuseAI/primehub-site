In this section, we will introduce how to use pre-packaged servers as model image. Here are the list of supported servers

- [TensorFlow2 server](model-deployment-prepackaged-server-tensorflow2)
- [PyTorch Server](model-deployment-prepackaged-server-pytorch)
- [SKLearn server](model-deployment-prepackaged-server-sklearn)

We can also build our own [Custom pre-packaged server](model-deployment-prepackaged-server-custom) for best flexibility.
