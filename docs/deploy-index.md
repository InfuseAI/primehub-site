**PrimeHub Deploy** is a standalone Model Deployment-only version of **PrimeHub Enterprise**. In addition to the PrimeHub Enterprise version of the Model Deployment feature, PrimeHub Deploy also features an Admin Dashboard that allows administrators to manage resources and access-control.

**PrimeHub v3**, in order to enhance the team/group-centric design, UI is revamped for introducing **Group-Context** experience to users that a current working project-group is required to be specified from associated groups of users, accordingly, the context/the operations are retained within the working group; therefore, it provides a consistent, intuitive experience of a working group/project.
