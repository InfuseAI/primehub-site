**PrimeHub Deploy** is a standalone Model Deployment-only version of **PrimeHub Enterprise**. In addition to the PrimeHub Enterprise version of the Model Deployment feature, PrimeHub Deploy also features an Admin Dashboard that allows administrators to manage resources and access-control.

From **PrimeHub v3.0**, there are huge changes on UI for introducing group-context experience that users have to pre-specify a current working project-group from joining groups, the context/the operations are limited within the working group; PrimeHub becomes more team-centric intuitively.

## User Portal

After login, it shows **User Portal**, on portal, the left side is **side menu**, the right side is the **context of the current working group**. At the top of the right side, there is a `Group:` dropdown for working groups switch. Users can switch the working group among joining groups easily.

### Side Menu

+ **Models (Alpha)** where users can deploy and serve models as services. See [Model Deployment](model_deployment/md-deployment).
