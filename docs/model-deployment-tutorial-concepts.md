In the following tutorials, we will present two different ways of model deployment.

1. [Deploy a Model by Pre-packaged Server](model-deployment-tutorial-prepackaged-image)
    - This is an elementary way to create a model deployment. We just need to provide the `location of trained model` and specify the `server image` hosted by InfuseAI.

2. [Deploy a Model by Image built from Language Wrapper](model-deployment-tutorial-model-image)
    - This is an advanced way as we need to build and push the model image. We can quickly go through entire workflow by using `model image` hosted by InfuseAI.
