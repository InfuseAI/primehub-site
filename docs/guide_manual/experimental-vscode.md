InfuseAI provides an experimental image which is pre-installed [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) allowing users to access VS Code running on a remote JupyterHub.

Here is the url of the image, `infuseai/docker-stacks:vscode-with-tf2-47543bcb-20200311-a`, from InfuseAI official registry.

1. Adding this image on Image Management of Admin Dashboard. ( Please contact PrimeHub administrators with it.)

2. Launching a JupyterHub from this added image.

3. We will see **VS Code** icon from the Notebook section, click it to open a new tab of VS Code.

4. We can start using it with the same experience of standalone VS CODE you have, clicking the first icon to show the menu.
