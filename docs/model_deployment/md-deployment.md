One of the last stages in the MLOps is Model Deployment that by integration of a machine learning model into an environment which can retrieve query data and respond with an inference/prediction. By serving models, scientists can also learn the performance of trained models in a practical circumstance.

By Models feature of PrimeHub Enterprise, scientists can deploy a model file directly with a specified image of pre-packaged server or can deploy a model image which already packages a model file into.
