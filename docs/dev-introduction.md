PrimeHub is a Kubernetes-based cloud-native Machine Learning platform.

We Provide PrimeHub Community and Enterprise installations. Prior to PrimeHub installation, a PrimeHub-ready Kubernetes cluster is required. PrimeHub supports multi-nodes and single-node. 

If you want a Kubernetes in your own way, please see the prerequisites or see guides of starting a fresh Kubernetes on GKE/EKS for PrimeHub. 

Just want to try PrimeHub on the own desktop/laptop? you may want to check the installation on single-node(easy-installation).

If a serious enterprising trial is preferred, please send the [request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_Z8JfIbYnvhOampGN_XXle4d3GVX04E8evnNI_Py3abth-A/viewform). We will have PrimeHub cloud dedicated to you.
