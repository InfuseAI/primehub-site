## ðŸš€ &NonBreakingSpace; Improvements

### Real-time resource dashboard update

System administrators can gain more insight with their Grafana dashboard. Instead of only seeing the status per node and GPU, system administrators now have an overall view of what the current resource utilization and GPU allocation per node is.

### Reuse installed packages

In addition to using group-shared images, users can now follow an instruction to reuse installed packages in jobs and notebook environments more easily.
