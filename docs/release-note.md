## ðŸš€ &NonBreakingSpace; Improvements

### Real-time resource dashboard update

System administrators can gain more insight with their Grafana dashboard (PrimeHub/GPU/Cluster). Instead of only seeing the status per node and GPU, system administrators now have an overall view of what the current resource utilization and GPU allocation per node is.

## ðŸ’« &NonBreakingSpace; More Things

### MATLAB image

MATLAB is a platform that aims to numeric computing, data analysis, and create models. InfuseAI now provides the PrimeHub-compatible image to launch a MATLAB environment on PrimeHub directly. See [How to launch MATLAB environment on PrimeHub](tasks/matlab-img) to learn more.

### Reuse installed packages

In addition to using group-shared images, users can now follow the guide to reuse installed packages in Jobs and Notebook environments more easily without repeating same packages installation. See [Customize Runtime Environment](tasks/customize-job-runtime)
