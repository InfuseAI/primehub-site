### Models (Beta)

Move Models from alpha to Beta, in beta we introduce two ways for the model deployment.

+ To deploy a *ready-to-serve packaged model image* which is [packaged by user already](model-deployment-language-wrapper-intro) directly using **Model Image** field only.

+ To deploy a model file using the **Model URI** field **with** a [specified pre-packaged image](model-deployment-prepackaged-server-intro) using **Model Image** field, under the hood, the model file will be packaged into a image, then the image will be deployed automatically.

+ [Tutorials](model-deployment-tutorial-concepts)
