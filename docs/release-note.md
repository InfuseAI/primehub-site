## ðŸŒŸ What's New

We are glad to announce our **PrimeHub v3.0** release. **PrimeHub v3.0** has a whole new ML user experience base on the **Group-Context** concept that ML users specify a current working project-group prior to any rest of operations. All of operations are performed within the working project-group. It is much different with the past PrimeHub v2 and it allows users to focus on the current project-group intuitively.
