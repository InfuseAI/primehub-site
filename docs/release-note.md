## ðŸŒŸ What's New

### Group Admin

### Models (Beta)

In Beta, there are two ways for the model deployment.

+ To deploy a *ready-to-serve packaged model image* which is [packaged by user already](model-deployment-language-wrapper-intro) directly using **Model Image** field only.

+ To deploy a model file using the **Model URI** field **with** a [specified pre-packaged image](model-deployment-prepackaged-server-intro) using **Model Image** field, under the hood, the model file will be packaged into a image, then the image will be deployed automatically.

+ [Tutorials](model-deployment-tutorial-concepts)

### Notebook Logs

Finally, users can investigate the failure of a spawning Notebook from the log stored in phfs.

### Shared Space: Upload

Allow uploading to groups' phfs folder space directly from UI
