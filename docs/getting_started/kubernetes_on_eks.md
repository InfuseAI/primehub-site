This document guides you to deploy a Kubernetes on AWS EKS for PrimeHub.

## One-Click Install

The easiest and recommended way to install PrimeHub on [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/eks/) is through our 1-Click install on [one.primehub.io](https://one.primehub.io/). With just 1-click, PrimeHub will setup everything you need for your machine learning adventure on a cloud-native environment.

The technology behind this is by using [AWS Cloud Development Kit(CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/cdk/), you can create the whole stack on your AWS account without having to setup the complicated infrastructure and configuration files.
