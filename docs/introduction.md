title: PrimeHub v3.3

## Introduction

**PrimeHub v3**, in order to enhance the team/group-centric design, UI is revamped for introducing **Group-Context** experience to users that a current working project-group is required to be specified from associated groups of users, accordingly, the context/the operations are retained within the working group; therefore, it provides a consistent, intuitive experience of a working group/project; in the past PrimeHub v2, users had to choose a group to perform actions every time repeatedly which didn't provide a project-centric experience consistently.

In addition, there are two portals now, one is **User Portal** which provides general user-facing features, the other is **Admin Portal** which provides adminstration features.

## PrimeHub v3.3+

**Group Admin**ï¼š v3.3+ onwards, PrimeHub adds this role in a group. PrimeHub Admin is able to [assign group members Group Admin](guide_manual/admin-group#members); Group Admin is able to utilize dedicated new features from User Portal such as [Images](group-image).
