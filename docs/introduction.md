**PrimeHub** is a platform for groups of data scientists. Based on group-centric design, users can share datasets, artifacts and co-work easily within same groups/projects, which accelerates collaborative development for groups and facilitates resources management.

PrimeHub platform is composed of **User Portal** and **Admin Portal**.

**User Portal** incorporates scientists-facing prominent features that scientists are able to have pipelines by submitting/scheduling jobs, prepare data/generate models from Notebook and serve models by deployments. See [User Guide](quickstart/login-portal-user).
