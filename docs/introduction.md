**PrimeHub** is a *Kubernetes*-based platform designed for groups of data scientists. It aims at being a all-in-one enterprise machine learning platform to provide seamless MLOps experience.

Adopting the group-centric design, scientists can share datasets, artifacts and co-work easily within same groups/projects, which accelerates collaborative development for project groups, besides, scientists are capable of developing models, serving and monitoring with full governance and transparency. In terms of platform administration, administrators are able to manage access control, resources quotas control for project groups accordingly, which facilitates the efficiency of resources managements.

### Key Capabilities

+ Cluster Computing
+ One-click Research Environments
+ Easy Dataset Loading
+ Management of Resource & Quota Privileges
+ Custom Deep Learning Environments
+ Enterprise-Class Account Management

## Platform

PrimeHub platform is composed of **User Portal** and **Admin Portal**.

### User Portal

incorporates scientists-facing prominent features that scientists are able to turn workflows into automating pipelines by Job submission/schedule, able to prepare data/generate trained models from Notebook and able to serve container-wrapped models by Model Deployment.

See [User Guide](quickstart/login-portal-user).
