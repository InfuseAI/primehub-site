PrimeHub is a Kubernetes-based cloud-native Machine Learning platform.

We provide various ways of installation, depending upon your requirements and resources.

---

## Installation

Prior to installating PrimeHub, a suitable Kubernetes cluster is required. PrimeHub supports both multi-node Kubernetes clusters, and single-node MicroK8s clusters.

If you already have a your own Kubernete cluster, please ensure it meets the [prerequisites for PrimeHub](getting_started/prerequisites). For managaed Kubernetes services, please see our guides for [GKE](getting_started/kubernetes_on_gke) and [AWS EKS](getting_started/kubernetes_on_eks).

### Katacoda

Before getting stuck in, we have a [PrimeHub CE installation scenario on Katacoda &neArr;](https://www.katacoda.com/infuseai). This will help in understanding the installation progress/requirements, and what PrimeHub CE is capable of.

### Setup Kubernetes for PrimeHub

Before installing PrimeHub, a Kubernetes cluster is required. Please ensure your cluster is ready for PrimeHub by checking the following prerequisties:

- [Prerequisites](getting_started/prerequisites.md)

If PrimeHub on GKE/EKS is one of your preference, you may want to start from our guides to set up a PrimeHub-ready-Kubernetes:

- [Install Kubernetes on GKE](getting_started/kubernetes_on_gke.md)
- [Install Kubernetes on AWS EKS](getting_started/kubernetes_on_eks)

### Setup PrimeHub
