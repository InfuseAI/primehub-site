PrimeHub is a Kubernetes-based cloud-native Machine Learning platform.

With AWS CloudFormation, the distance between you and ready-to-use PrimeHub is just 1-click!  All you need is an AWS account, 30 minutes, and a cup of tea or coffee.

Don't have an AWS account? We have [other ways](../install-manually) for you.
