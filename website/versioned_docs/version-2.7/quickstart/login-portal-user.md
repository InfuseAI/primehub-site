+ **Job Submission (Beta)** where users can submit/schedule multiple jobs for time-consuming tasks. See [Job Submission](../job-submission-feature), [Job Scheduler](../job-scheduling-feature).

+ **Model Deployment (Alpha)** where users can deploy and serve models as services. See [Model Deployment](../model-deployment-feature).

+ **User Guide** It is redirected to `Documentation` where users can find useful guides, tutorials and documents of PrimeHub.
